This work spans a broad area covering topics associated with both traditional information technology cybersecurity as well as cybersecurity for mobile networks requiring radio frequency (RF) isolation. This environment ensures that its interior volume is shielded from signals radiated from outside the chamber. Such a shielded research facility can come in the form of either an anechoic chamber or a reverberation chamber. \\n\\nIn an anechoic chamber, the walls and ceiling inside the chamber are equipped with absorbing material such that signals radiated from within the chamber are absorbed and do not scatter (ideally). In a reverberation chamber, the opposite is true. The walls and ceiling in a reverberation chamber are designed to be reflective (metallic) at radio frequencies of interest. Most anechoic and reverberation chambers are designed, built, and used for testing pursuant to specific electromagnetic capability (EMC) standards (e.g., IEC 61000-4-3). As this chamber will be used for wireless communications research, it is neither feasible nor reasonable to specify the exact application and/or measurements that will take place within the chamber.\\n\\nThe purpose of this requirement is to obtain a free-standing RF Shielded Chamber for research purposes. Installation shall take place at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence facility in Rockville, MD.

While American small businesses are found to sell the required chambers, no contractors offering domestic products were identified. \\n\\nNIST conducted a competitive acquisition on a total small business set-aside basis for a reverberation and anechoic chamber meeting NIST’s minimum specifications. The solicitation was posted with ample time for all potential contractors to submit a quotation for the commercial requirement. The solicitation was later also extended by a week to maximize opportunity for competition. Two quotations were received in reference to the solicitation. Only one quotation, from AP Americas, Inc., was determined to be technically acceptable and this quotation included foreign end products. The other quotation received did not include the required fire suppression system, and was therefore non-compliant with NIST’s required specifications and was technically unacceptable. The only technically acceptable products quoted to NIST are therefore manufactured outside of the United States.  After evaluating all quotations in accordance with the solicitation, the quoter that represents the best value to the Government is AP Americas, Inc., offering foreign end products. NIST intends to purchase a reverberation and anechoic chamber that is primarily manufactured in Germany.
